## A Stirring Text Adventure

My very first text adventure and fully fledged program - an assignment I had in C for Spring 2021.

I removed other student's names and work (as well as the professor's) - it was initially one large text adventure game that we all pushed to Git for practice.

Prof's comments said "longest assignment I've ever graded" (nearly 1k lines jfc sorry dude).


I listened to Chili Con Carne on repeat for nearly 5 weeks while I coded this, so please excuse the very candid tone in the comments, I had fun if you couldn't tell.


I don't intend to actually refactor this BUT I may port the code into Unity some day and probably give it some graphics and other pizazz. 

Don't hold me to that.
